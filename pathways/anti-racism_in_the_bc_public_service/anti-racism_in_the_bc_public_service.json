    "acknowledgments": "The Corporate Learning Branch would like to acknowledge the support we received from many of our colleagues and partners in multiple branches/ministries during the development of this learning resource. We also appreciate the invaluable comments we received during our engagement sessions.\n\nIn particular, our sincere thanks go out to colleagues and partners at the following entities:\n\n* Policy & Legislation, BC Data Service, CITZ\n* Multiculturalism & Anti-Racism Branch, AG\n* PSA REDI, Policy and Employee Relations\n* SDPR Inclusion, Diversity and Cultural Safety (IDCS) & Anti-Racism 101 course\n* BIPOC Employee Resource Group\n* Indigenous Employees Network",
    "contentWarning": "> \"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\" — James Baldwin\n\nThis learning pathway deals with sensitive topics. It touches on racism, inequity, power structures and the inherent imbalances that exist in our society, culture, and organizations.\n\nThe content of this pathway is primarily tailored for those new to the subject area. We, however, recognize that thousands of BC Public Service employees who represent the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and other marginalized communities are also completing this learning and may have a different baseline of knowledge and lived experience.\n\nIrrespective of your life experiences, be prepared for moments when you will feel uncomfortable. Know that discomfort is normal and is often a prerequisite for positive change and growth. When you feel discomfort, it's not a sign that something is wrong — it's a sign that you are doing something right.\n\nSome learners may find the training overwhelming due to personal experiences with racism and other forms of discrimination. In such circumstances, we encourage you to step back, prioritize emotional health, and return to the content.\n\nAs employees, you have access to [Employee and Family Assistance Services](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/all-employees/health-safety-and-sick-leave-resources/health/efas?keyword=EFAS) anytime you need. You will also find resources and other workplace support mechanisms related to anti-racism within module four and five of these pathways.\n\nCanadians in crisis can also call or text 9-8-8 24/7 to access bilingual, trauma-informed, and culturally appropriate mental health, and suicide prevention support.\n\nLet's dive into the learning journey with open minds and hearts as we strive to make BC Public Service an equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist organization.\n\nIn the words of Maya Angelou, **\"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.\"** This learning pathway is designed with that learning spirit in mind.",
